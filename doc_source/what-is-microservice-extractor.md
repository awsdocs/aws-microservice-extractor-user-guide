# What Is AWS Microservice Extractor for \.NET?<a name="what-is-microservice-extractor"></a>

AWS Microservice Extractor for \.NET is an assistive modernization tool that helps to reduce the time and effort required to break down large, monolithic applications running on the AWS Cloud or on premises into smaller, independent services\. These services can be operated and managed independently\. 

Microservice Extractor analyzes the code of your target application, and creates a visualization of the source code of the application\. The visualization includes classes, namespaces, and method calls between them\. The visualization of your application helps you to logically group functionalities based on criteria such as class dependencies, namespaces, and call counts\. When you isolate the functionalities of the application into groups, Microservice Extractor provides assistive guidance to refactor your code base to prepare it for extraction into smaller services\. When the code base is ready for extraction, Microservice Extractor extracts the functionalities into separate code solutions\. You can then manually edit and deploy these code solutions as independent services\.
