# Runtime profiling<a name="drfit-runtime-profiling"></a>

The AWS Microservice Extractor for \.NET tool includes an application runtime profiler to provide call count data with dependency details in the visualization of the application\. The output of the profiler is processed by the assessment tool to create the graph\. The visualization shows class level call counts to help you understand the traffic patterns of your application\. This visual representation helps you to focus resources during the extraction process and to isolate areas of high value\. The runtime profiler is a \.dll file that must be included when you run your application in a test or integration environment with data that is representative of the production environment\. CLR profiling is supported\. For steps to run the profiler, see the [Runtime profiling prerequisites](microservice-extractor-install.md#microservice-extractor-install-runtime-profiling)\.
