# View application details<a name="microservice-extractor-details"></a>

When an application is successfully onboarded, you can view details about the application by choosing it from the **Applications** page\. You will be taken to the **Application details** tab\. From here, you can view and **Edit** the application details\. If you previously launched the visualization for the application, you can choose the **Visualization \(nodes and dependencies\)** tab to view the graphical visualization of your application\. For more information about how to work with the visualization, see [Work with the application visualization](microservice-extractor-use-visualization.md)\.

The application details page displays a summary of the onboarding details that you entered for the application\. It also includes the location of the application logs, log status, and descriptions of any log errors\. You can edit the name and description, source code files, and runtime profiling data by choosing **Edit**\. If you make changes to the application details, the application analysis is performed again, and the application visualization is refreshed\. If you cancel the edit, no changes will be applied\.
